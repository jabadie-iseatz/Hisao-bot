Hi.  Couldn't think of a better way to contact you.  I've upgraded your DFT.BA Chrome plugin to work with the newer 
code restrictions.  After doing it, I know why you didn't bother to begin with.  It was a massive pain!  Anyway, I 
really want to get these changes in, and my name in as a collaborator.  How would you like to proceed?

Thanks.
